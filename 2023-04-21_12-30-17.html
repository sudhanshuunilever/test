<body style="background-color: red;">

<p>I'm a coder, the one who codes to make magic<br>
Taking deep breaths, I try to write a script that's tragic<br>
A world of ones and zeros, no limit to what I can create<br>
A few bugs here and there, they never make me irate<br>

There's no better feeling than debuggging lines and lines of code<br>
I'm never giving up until I'm done, until it's completely load<br>
Every hour I spend in front of the screen helps me grow<br>
I'm determined to create the best programs that you know<br>

I can make silly games, or I can even create a website<br>
Coding has become a part of me, like I'm the only one that can write<br>
No matter how challenging it seems, I'm never going to quit<br>
I'm a coder, cant you see, a proud member of the coding elite<br>

I can make all sorts of stuff, you'll see what I can do<br>
Make your dreams come true and it'll all be thanks to me, yeah<br>
Put your faith in me, I know what I can do, yeah<br>
My programming skills will never be through, yeah<br>
